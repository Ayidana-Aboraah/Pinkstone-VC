# Bronze_Hermes
 The source code for a small business app. This code is not really meant to be used by another person and is likely to be **ABSOLUTELY** horrible to implement, espcially because I modified the fyne bindings to allow for the custom type Sale since there are no generics in go. I hope someone will find the code itself useful, but I'll actually give you something useful below.
